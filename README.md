# DA_Projects
This repository contains the projects related to data pre-processing, investigation, visualizations and analyzing.

As a student of Data Analysis training program, I had a chance to learn data preparation concepts, insights investigation, growth opportunities based on DA, using specific tools (Python, SQL, Tableau).

## Project 1: Research of ads for the sale of apartments

Based on the Yandex.Realty service data, the market value was determined real estate objects of different types, typical parameters of apartments, depending on distance from the center. Data preprocessing has been carried out, added new data, histograms, boxplots, scatterplots are constructed.

**Skills and tools**
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, data visualization, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing

## Project 2: Defining the most suitable plan for telecom company

Based on the data of the mobile operator's customers, analyze the behavior of customers and search for the optimal tariff plan.
A preliminary analysis of the use of tariffs on a sample of customers was carried out, analyzed the behavior of customers when using the services of the operator and recommended optimal sets of services for users. The hypotheses about the difference in the revenue of subscribers of different tariffs and difference in revenue of subscribers from Moscow and other regions were tested.

**Skills and tools**
Python, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, descriptive statistics, statistical hypothesis testing

## Project 3: Determining patterns that affect the success of computer games

Using historical data on sales of computer games, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms, identify patterns that determine the success of a game.
The parameters that determine the success of the game in different regions of the world are revealed. Data preprocessing and analysis were carried out. Current selected period for analysis. Compiled portraits of users in each region. Verified hypotheses: the average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same; the average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different. The analysis used Student's t-test for independent samples.

**Skills and tools**
Python, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, exploratory data analysis, descriptive statistics, data preprocessing, statistical hypothesis testing

## Project 4: Analysis of the behavior of mobile application users

Analyze the sales funnel and evaluate the results of A/A/B testing based on data from the use of a mobile application for selling food products.

In this project, I studied the principles of event analytics. I built sales funnel, explored the path of users to purchase. analyzed A/B test results for the introduction of new fonts. Compared 2 control groups, made sure that the traffic was divided correctly, and then compared it with the test group. It is revealed that the new font will not significantly affect user behavior.

**Skills and tools**
A/B testing, Python, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, data visualization, statistical hypothesis testing, product metrics, event analytics
